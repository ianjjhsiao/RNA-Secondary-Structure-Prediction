RNA secondary structure prediction is a crucial area of
research in RNA vaccines. However, predicting the 2-D
structure is a challenging problem due to the number of possible configurations of RNA bonds and the sequential nature
of RNA. Traditional prediction methods like ViennaFold, use
thermodynamic principles but struggle with complex structures. Recently, deeplearning has shown promise in advancing the RNA secondary structure prediction field by leveraging transformer and LSTM architectures that are effective
for sequence-based tasks while also incorporating thermodynamic principles. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of RNA secondary structure models; EternaFold, MXFold2, and Vienna ViennaFold as our benchmark. We evaluate these models on the basis of their performance across different sequence lengths and structural
motifs. In addition, we performed hyperparameter tuning
to optimize accuracy and explored a hyper ensemble model
using a consensus structure approach.
